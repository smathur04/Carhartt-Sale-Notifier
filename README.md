Carhartt Sale Notifier

This program is designed to check the Carhartt webstore sale section every 60 seconds to see if any new items have been listed on sale. If it detects a new item on sale, it will use Twilio's API to send a text with the item's name and product link. 

To have this program work for you all you need is to clone the repository and then enter your own credenitials in the text.py file. This may require you to create an account with Twilio. 

After that the program can be further customized to run as a background application, you can change the interval between state checks, or modify the scrape link to any other sale section on the Carhartt website.
